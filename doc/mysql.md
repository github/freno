# MySQL

`freno` was written to assist in controlling writes to `MySQL` clusters.

### Background

`MySQL` installments typically include a master and multiple replicas. Aggressive write to the master may cause increased replication lags. Replication lags have multiple undesired effects, such as stale replica data.

Common operations apply massive changes to MySQL data, such as:

- Archiving/purging of old data (e.g. via `pt-archiver`)
- Online migrations (e.g. via `gh-ost`)
- Population of newly added columns
- Bulk loading of data (e.g. importing data from Hadoop via `sqoop`)
- Any application generated massive update

Such operations can and should be broken to smaller subtasks (e.g. `100` rows at a time) and throttle based on replication lag.

Tools such as `gh-ost` and `pt-archiver` already support auto-throttling by replication lag, however:

- They use different internal implementations
- They need to be _given_ the list of servers
- They do not adapt automatically to a change in the list of relevant servers (`gh-ost` can be updated dynamically, but again must be _told_ the identities of the replicas)

`freno` provides a unified service which self-adapts to changes in MySQL replica inventory.

### Configuration

Let's dissect the MySQL part of the [sample config file](../resources/freno.conf.sample.json):

You will find the top-level configuration:

```json
"MySQL": {
  "User": "some_user",
  "Password": "${mysql_password_env_variable}",
  "MetricQuery": "select unix_timestamp(now(6)) - unix_timestamp(ts) as lag_check from meta.heartbeat order by ts desc limit 1",
  "ThrottleThreshold": 1.0,
  "IgnoreHostsCount": 0,
  "Clusters": {
  }
}
```

These params apply in general to all MySQL clusters, unless specified differently (overridden) on a per-cluster basis.

- `User`, `Password`: these can be specified as plaintext, or in a `${some_env_variable}` format, in which case `freno` will look up its environment for specified variable. (e.g. to match the above config, a `shell` script invoking `freno` can `export mysql_password_env_variable=flyingcircus`)
- `MetricQuery`:
  - if not provided, `freno` will assume you're interested in replication lag, and will issue a `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` to extract `Seconds_behind_master`
  - We strongly recommend using a custom heartbeat mechanism such as `pt-heartbeat`, with subsecond resolution. The sample query above works well with `pt-heartbeat` subsecond timestamps.
  - Strictly speaking, you don't have to provide a replication-lag metric. This could be any query that reports any metric. However you're likely interested in replication lag to start with.
  - Note: the sefault time unit for replication lag is _seconds_
- `ThrottleThreshold`: an upper limit for valid collected values. If value collected (via `MetricQuery`) is below or equal to `ThrottleThreshold`, cluster is considered to be good to write to. If higher, then cluster writes will need to be throttled.
  - Note: use _seconds_ as replication lag time unit. In the above we throttle above `1.0` seconds.
- `IgnoreHostsCount`: number of hosts that can be ignored while aggregating cluster's values. For example, if `IgnoreHostsCount` is `2`, then up to `2` hosts that have errors are silently ignored. Or, if there's no errors, the two highest values will be ignored (so if these two values exceed the cluster's threshold, `freno` may still be happy to allow writes to the cluster).

Looking at clusters configuration:

```json
"Clusters": {
  "prod4": {
    "ThrottleThreshold": 0.8,
    "HAProxySettings": {
      "Host": "my.haproxy.mydomain.com",
      "Port": 1001,
      "PoolName": "my_prod4_pool"
    }
  },
  "local": {
    "User": "msandbox",
    "Password": "msandbox",
    "IgnoreHostsCount": 1,
    "StaticHostsSettings" : {
        "Hosts": [
          "127.0.0.1:22293",
          "127.0.0.1:22294",
          "127.0.0.1:22295"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

This introduces two clusters: `prod4` and `local`. `freno` will only serve requests for these two clusters. Any other request (e.g. `/check/archive/mysql/prod7`) will be answered with `HTTP 500` -- an unknown metric

Noteworthy:

- `prod4` chooses to (but doesn't have to) override the `ThrottleThreshold` to `0.8` seconds
- `prod4` list of servers is dictated by `HAProxy`. `freno` will routinely and dynamically poll given HAProxy server for list of hosts. These will include any hosts not in `NOLB`.
- `local` cluster chooses to override `User`, `Password` and `IgnoreHostsCount`.
- `local` cluster defines a static list of hosts.


### Non lag metrics

`freno` isn't necessarily about replication lag. You may choose to use different thresholds appropriate for your setup and workload. For example, you may choose to monitor the master (as opposed of the replicas) and read some metric such as `threads_running`. An example configuration would be:

```json
"Clusters": {
  "master8": {
    "MetricQuery": "show global variables like 'threads_running'",
    "ThrottleThreshold": 50,
    "User": "msandbox",
    "Password": "msandbox",
    "StaticHostsSettings" : {
        "Hosts": [
          "my.master8.vip.com:3306"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

`freno` explicitly recognizes `show global ...` statements and reads the result's numeric value.

Otherwise you may provide any query that returns a single row, single numeric column.
